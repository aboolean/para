        <p>Para is a prototype digital illustration tool tool that uses direct manipulation to define and edit procedural artwork. Through creating and altering vector paths, artists can define iterative distributions and parametric constraints.</p>

        <p>Para was started in the Creative Technologies Lab at Adobe Research. Currently, Para is under development in the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab with continued contributions from Adobe Research. The software is part of a research project in broadening participation in procedural art and design. The project is hosted on GitHub, and is available for use under the MIT software license.</p>
